NXCLIENT - Version 6.6.8

Usage: nxclient [OPTIONS]

--dialog TYPE [--caption TITLE] [--message MESSAGE] [--local]
              [--window ID] [--class {info|warning|error}]
              [--allowmultiple]

  Show a dialog box. The option must be followed by a 'type' parame-
  ter which specifies the type of dialog.

  TYPE can be either:

  yesno
  ok
  error
  panic
  quit

  The user should specify a caption and a message to be shown. The
  option --local can be used to specify the proxy mode.

  The --class option specifies the class of the message. When no class
  is specified the message will be assumed to be of the class 'Info'. 

  The --allowmultiple option specifies the possibility to launch more
  than one dialog with the same message.

--monitor

  Run the "NoMachine Monitor" application for tracking users when
  connected either to the local display or to the master session.
  This application allows to send a message to the selected user
  and to disconnect him/her.

--printer PRINTER_NAME

  Show a dialog box with the list of CUPS printer drivers found on
  the server.

  It may return:

  - Exit code 0 and the name of the driver selected by the user.
    The name of the driver is written on the STDIN.

  - Exit code 1 in the case of an error. The error message is
    printed on the STDERR.

  - Exit code 2 and no error message, if the user chose to abort
    the operation.

--version

  Output version information and exit.

--display

  Specify the X11 display where the client must connect. The option
  is only useful on platforms where the client is using the X-Window
  protocol for the display.

All options can be given with a single dash (as in 'nxclient -help').
This is for backward compatibility with older versions. Note that the
single-dash format is deprecated and will be likely removed in future
versions.
